There's a jumble of pipes.
On the ground is a cut up laundry bag.

Even with the flashlight the ceiling is too high to see. There are large mirrors bordering the room.
There are the remains of an unknown animal on the cutting board. There are miscellaneous items on a small table to your left.
There is a table nearby.
The table seems to be set for a large meal, there is nothing else to note.
There is a ladder going up to the hole.
There is an empty drawer behind the desk.
There are some bottles inside.
There is a nightstand next to the bed.



There are crates of old items all over the room and a suit of armor in the corner.
There is a hole in the wall to the west.
